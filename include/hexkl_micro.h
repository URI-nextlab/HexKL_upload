  Copies a preprocessed 32×32 int8 weight tile into VTCM memory using the correct

  where the extracted tile will be stored.

  @param[in] input_matrix
  Pointer to the source matrix containing activation data, located in any memory
  (e.g., DDR). The matrix must be zero-padded to full tile size on both dimensions.
